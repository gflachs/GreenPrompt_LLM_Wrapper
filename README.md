## Purpose

This service is designed to manage the lifecycle of a specified Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM will be downloaded from Huggingface and deployed for use. The service is responsible for the following tasks:

-   Downloading the LLM from Huggingface.
-   Deploying and managing the LLM lifecycle.
-   Sending prompts to the LLM and receiving responses.
-   Measuring the SCI Score of the LLM.

### Key Features:

=> File-Based Command Execution: Reads commands from a file, executes them, and outputs results (including the SCI Score) to another file.
=> Monitoring and Logging: Keeps track of the LLM's status and logs all interactions for transparency.

----------

## Architecture

The architecture includes the following components:

1.  **Huggingface API**: For downloading the specified LLM.
2.  **Wrapper**: Manages the LLM lifecycle, including health checks, deployment, and responsiveness.
3.  **File System**: Reads commands and writes results (including SCI Score).

Diagram Overview: _(Add a diagram if available)_

## SCI-Score: Sustainability and Carbon Impact Score

The **SCI-Score** is a metric used to evaluate the environmental impact of AI-generated responses. It helps measure energy consumption and carbon emissions, encouraging responsible usage and optimization of AI models.

### Why SCI-Score Matters

Incorporating the SCI-Score aligns the project with global sustainability goals by:

-   **Raising Awareness**: Informing users about the ecological cost of their interactions with the LLMs.
-   **Encouraging Optimization**: Driving efforts to improve the efficiency of model usage.
-   **Promoting Green AI**: Demonstrating a commitment to environmentally conscious AI development.

### How is the SCI-Score Calculated?

The SCI-Score is calculated using the following formula:

SCI = ((E * I) + M) per R

Where:

-   **E** = Energy consumed by software in kWh.
-   **I** = Carbon emitted per kWh of energy, in gCO2/kWh.
-   **M** = Carbon emitted through the hardware running the software.
-   **R** = Functional unit, such as per user or per request.

To simplify this process, the **`calculator-sci-score.py` application** is provided. This tool automates the calculation of the SCI-Score. Users only need to input the required values into the application, and it performs all computations based on the SCI formula.

----------

### Steps to Use `calculator-sci-score.py`:

1.  **Input Required Data**:
    
    -   **Energy Consumption (E)**: Enter the amount of energy consumed by the software in kWh.
    -   **Carbon Intensity (I)**: Input the carbon emissions per kWh for the region where the software runs.
    -   **Hardware Emissions (M)**: Provide the carbon emissions associated with the hardware.
    -   **Functional Unit (R)**: Define the scaling unit, such as "per request" or "per session."
2.  **Run the Application**: Execute the Python script `calculator-sci-score.py`:
    
    ```bash
    python calculator-sci-score.py
    
    ```
