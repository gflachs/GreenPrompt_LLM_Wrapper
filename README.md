## Purpose

This service is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a specified LLM. The LLM will be downloaded from Huggingface. The service deploys the LLM and manages the lifecycle of the LLM. The service will be responsible for the following:
- Downloading the LLM from Huggingface
- Deploying the LLM
- Managing the lifecycle of the LLM
- Sending prompts to the LLM
- Receiving responses from the LLM
- Measuring the SCI Score of the LLM

To achieve this, the service will read commands from a file in the file system. The service will read the commands from the file and execute the commands. The service will write the output of the commands ( meas the resulting state of the LLM) to a file in the file system. The service will also write the SCI Score of the LLM to a file in the file system.

## Contribution

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! To ensure the quality and consistency of our code, we kindly ask you to follow these guidelines.

### Branch Protection

- All changes must be made through **Pull Requests**.
- We have **branch protection**: at least **one review** from another person is required before changes can be merged.
- All **checks must pass** before a merge is allowed.
- Make sure your branch is **up to date** with the target branch to avoid merge conflicts.

### Code Quality

- **Linting and code quality** must meet the defined standards. We use tools like **flake8** (Python) or similar linters to ensure the code is clean and readable.
- Use **pre-commit hooks** to check compliance with the standards before committing your code.

### No New Bugs

- Ensure that your code does not introduce **new errors**. Run all relevant **unit tests** and extend the test suite if necessary.
- Make sure that **existing tests do not fail**. New changes must not affect existing functionality.

### Tests

- Each new feature should be covered with appropriate **unit tests** or **integration tests** (minimum coverage 70%).
- Run all tests to ensure that existing functionality is not affected.

### Documentation

- All changes to the code should be documented in **comments** and/or in the **README.md**, if they affect usage.
- Clearly explain **why** you made the changes so that other developers can understand the motivation behind them.

### Pull Request (PR) Description

- Each PR should contain a **clear description** of the changes made.
- Explain why the change is necessary and what problem it solves.
- Reference relevant **issues** (e.g., `Fixes #123`) if available.

# UserInstruction
open a terminal and navigate to the App folder (or in vs code right click on the App folder and open in integrated Terminal)

## Enter the following command in the terminal
fastapi dev main.py

## Leave terminal open and open second terminal - Execute the following terminal commands one after the other, what the app does should be visible in the first terminal and in the log  

## Aufruf um die get_status Methode zu testen 
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/get_status" -Method GET
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/get_status


## Call to test the get_status method 

## Define the target URL
$uri = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/deploy"  

## Define the JSON body
$body = @{
    modeltyp = "text-generation"
    model = "TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0"

            device_map = "auto"
        }
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10  # Convert to JSON with sufficient depth

## Perform the POST request
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"

## Output the response
$response.Content



### Aufruf um die process_prompt Methode zu testen

# Define the API endpoint
$uri = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/process_prompt"  

## Define the JSON body
$body = @{
    question = "What is the capital of France?"
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10  # Convert the hashtable to JSON format
